<div style="text-align: justify;">
  <p>The current utilization of vibration sensors in industries predominantly relies on piezoelectric-based devices. However,   these devices have limitations as their active components endure continuous mechanical loading, resulting in a limited service  life. Moreover, these sensors require dedicated mounting facilities such as magnetic mounting or mechanical fasteners.</p>

  <p>The implementation of Industry 4.0 has further escalated the number of connected devices globally, with an estimated   increase from 50.1 billion (2023) to 75 billion in just two years. Consequently, this rapid growth also translates to an  increased global energy demand, necessitating the development of self-powered sensors or alternative energy sources that can   be harnessed locally. </p>

  <p>In order to tackle these challenges presented by Industry 4.0 and the ever-growing energy demands, we have successfully  designed and developed easy-to-mount vibration sensors based on triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) technology. These   TENG-based sensors not only provide self-powering capabilities but also offer a convenient mounting solution. </p>
